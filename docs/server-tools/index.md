## Features of the Server Tools Tab

The Server Tools tab offers several administrative features:

1. **Set Next Map**
   - Allows you to select the next map to be played after the current match ends.

2. **Ban a Player**
   - Enables you to ban a player from the server. You can specify the player to be banned through their in-game Name.

3. **Toggle Bots and Autobalancing**
   - Allows you to enable or disable bots and the autobalancing feature. Autobalancing ensures teams are evenly matched.

4. **Set Bot Difficulty**
