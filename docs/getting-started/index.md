## Introduction

Welcome to the guide for configuring and launching your dedicated Midnight Ghost Hunt server!

This guide aims to help you understand the key files and folders in your server setup, providing a solid foundation for effectively managing and configuring your server.

Before diving into the details, we recommend choosing your platform. You can set up your server on either [Windows](../running-mgh-server-windows/) or [Linux](../running-mgh-server-linux/).

Once you've chosen your platform, you can follow our step-by-step instructions to get your server up and running.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, the community is [here to help](https://discord.gg/midnightghosthunt)!

Happy ghost hunting!
