# Running the MGH Dedicated Server on Windows

To run the MGH Dedicated Server on Windows, it's as simple as just downloading and running the “Midnight Ghost Hunt Dedicated Server” on Steam. To do this, make sure that the “Midnight Ghost Hunt Dedicated Server” is fully downloaded. Then right-click on it in Steam, select “Manage” and “Browse local files”.

To configure the server, create a new file called `CustomRules.ini` in the same folder and fill it out according to your needs.

> For more information about configuring your server, please refer to the [Custom Rules](../custom-rules/) page.


Now an explorer window opens in which you only have to execute the `start_server.bat`.
